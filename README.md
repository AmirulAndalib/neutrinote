# neutriNote (Community Edition)
--------------------------------

## What is neutriNote?
-----------------------

In a nutshell, all-in-one preservation of written thoughts, be those text, math (LaTeX), rich markdown, drawings, etc.,  in fully searchable plain text (universal UTF-8).  

neutriNote is designed to be ultra compact so as to operate smoothly on as many aging hardwares as possible.

> **Community Edition**: Pretty much identical to [**Play Store Edition**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appmindlab.nano) except a small set of features that make use of Google related dependencies.  
>
> While almost every aspect of neutriNote can be [customized](https://appml.github.io/nano/), Community Edition should permit the ultimate customization at source code level which would fulfill highly specific needs such as custom ROM bundling, personal productivity builds, etc.


## Uncluttered UI
-----------------

Fine-tuned user interface elements to reduce app switching. Accessible search filters for precise navigation to your note contents with minimum taps.


## Customization
----------------

Your workflow can be further automated by Tasker, Barcode Scanner, ColorDict, and other add-ons, or by connecting neutriNote's repository to web-based services. Options available to deep configure your note taking process.  


## Backup
---------

Multiple ways to backup your notes.  Freedom to pick a cloud backend that works for you: open source P2P <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nutomic.syncthingandroid">Syncthing</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appmindlab.connector">Dropbox</a>, or third party Google Drive, Box, OneDrive components.
