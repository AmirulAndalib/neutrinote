# neutriNote (Community Edition)


## What is neutriNote?

In a nutshell, all-in-one preservation of written thoughts, be those text, math (LaTeX), rich markdown, drawings, etc.,  in fully searchable plain text (universal UTF-8).  

neutriNote is designed to be ultra compact so as to operate smoothly on as many aging hardwares as possible.

> **Community Edition**: Pretty much identical to [**Play Store Edition**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appmindlab.nano) except a small set of features that make use of Google related dependencies.  
>
> While already the case that almost every aspect of neutriNote can be [customized](https://appml.github.io/nano/), Community Edition opens up the possibility to customize at source code level, which would appeal to highly specific needs such as custom ROM bundling, personal productivity builds, etc.
